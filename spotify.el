;; Keywords: multimedia, music, spotify
;; Package: spotify

;; Commentary:

;; This mode requires at least GNU Emacs 24.4 and Python 2.7

;; Before using this mode, first go the Spotify Web API console
;; <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications> and create a new
;; application, adding <http://localhost:8591/> as the redirect URI.
;;
;; After requiring `spotify', make sure to define the client id and client
;; secrets, along with some other important settings:
;;
;; (custom-set-variables
;;  '(spotify-oauth2-client-id "client-id")
;;  '(spotify-oauth2-client-secret "client-secret"))
;;
;; See 'README.md' for usage information.
