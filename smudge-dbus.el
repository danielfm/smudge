;;; Commentary:

;; This library handles controlling Spotify via the D-Bus interface.  It implements a set of
;; multimethod-like functions that are dispatched in smudge-controller.el.

;; Somehow shuffling, setting volume and loop status do not work as expected.  Querying the
;; attribute does not return the expected value and setting it has no effect.  The dbus interface of
;; Spotify seems to be broken.
