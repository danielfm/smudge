;;; spotify-client.el --- control the Spotify app from Emacs  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2014-2018 Daniel Fernandes Martins

;; Keywords: multimedia, music, spotify, spotify-client
;; Package: spotify-client
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4") (simple-httpd "1.5") (oauth2 "0.16") (request "0.3"))

;;; Commentary:

;; This mode requires at least GNU Emacs 24.4

;; Before using this mode, first go the Spotify Web API console
;; <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications> and create a new application, adding
;; <http://localhost:8080/spotify-client-callback> as the redirect URI (or whichever port you have
;; specified via customize).

;; After requiring `spotify-client', make sure to define the client id and client secrets, along with some
;; other important settings.  See README.md for the complete list of settings and usage information.
